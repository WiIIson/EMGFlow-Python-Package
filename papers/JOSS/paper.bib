	abstract = {A frequency domain filtering method is presented for the removal of power-line and other sinusoidal interference from electromyograms. The presence of such interference results in spikes in the complex-valued fast Fourier transform which can be considered to be outliers. The filter uses the outlier-robust Hampel identifier to detect spikes and replaces them with the median value of local values. The performance of the filter was tested using a set of simulated electromyograms and on experimental data. It was shown that the filter is more effective at rejecting interference than multiple notch filtering and spectral interpolation. The main advantages of using this method are that the frequencies at which the interference occurs need not be known a priori and that signals are not distorted in the absence of interference. In the case of single-frequency interference added to simulated and experimental data, errors in root-mean-squared amplitude and median frequency of <5% are reported.}

	ABSTRACT = {Electromyography (EMG) is gaining importance in many research and clinical applications, including muscle fatigue detection, control of robotic mechanisms and prostheses, clinical diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases and quantification of force. However, EMG signals can be contaminated by various types of noise, interference and artifacts, leading to potential data misinterpretation. Even assuming best practices, the acquired signal may still contain contaminants. The aim of this paper is to review methods employed to reduce the contamination of single channel EMG signals. Specifically, we focus on methods which enable a full reconstruction of the EMG signal without loss of information. This includes subtraction methods used in the time domain, denoising methods performed after the signal decomposition and hybrid approaches that combine multiple methods. Finally, this paper provides a discussion on the suitability of the individual methods based on the type of contaminant(s) present in the signal and the specific requirements of the application.},

This package provides clear documentation of utilized methodology, guided functionalities for semi-automatic feature estimation, and options for extensive customization. In this article, a brief introduction to the features of the package, and to its design workflow, are presented. To demonstrate the usage of the package in a real-world context, an advanced example of image valence estimation from physiological measurements (ECG, EMG, and EDA) is described.

	abstract={Cancer patients often experience loss in body weight and also a decrease in muscle mass, which results in the reduction of physical activity and mobilization of the patient. To decelerate the loss of muscle mass, as part of the cancer treatment patients frequently undergo physical therapy and considering the physical capabilities of the patients, with moderate loads. Moreover, frequent studies also observed for cancer patients, together with the decrease in muscle mass a shift into fast-twitch muscle fibers from slow-twitch fibers. The aim of our study therefore was to determine how motor fibers behave under moderate isometric load executed until total exhaustion. 11 university students (G1), and 14 elite athletes (G2) participated in the study. 65{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was determined for the biceps brachii muscle, and with this load holding a weight, participants had to sustain a 90 deg. isometric elbow flexion in a standing posture until complete fatigue occurred. EMG activity for the biceps brachii muscle was measured and frequency analysis was performed. 3 windows were determined in the fatiguing protocol: the first (W1), middle (W2), and last (W3) 5 s, and also frequency analysis for MVC was performed (MAX) between 0 and 260 Hz with 20 Hz wide frequency bands. The results indicate, that as the protocol progressed in time and the effect of fatigue increased (from W1 to W3) the activity of low frequency muscle fibers significantly increased (0-40 Hz) while activity of high frequency muscle fibers (60-260 Hz) significantly decreased for G1 and G2 groups identically. We can conclude, that training applied with constant moderate tension as fatigue increases will result in the increased activation of the lower frequency slow--twitch muscle fibers, but the increase of fatigue in the lower frequency fibers will not result in the increase in the activation level of the higher frequency fast-twitch fibers. Consequently, because as slow-twitch fibers are being used at moderate loads and even when fatigue occurs in these fibers the fast-twitch fibers will not work, higher muscle loads are needed if the aim is to activate fast-twitch fibers. Considering the shift into fast-twitch muscle fibers from slow-twitch fibers for cancer patients, in some cases if the patient's age and physical status allows during the physical treatment, higher loads and consequently higher levels of activation might be beneficial for the retardment of loss concerning the fast-twitch fiber mass.},

	abstract = {We present an automated algorithm for unified rejection and repair of bad trials in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Our method capitalizes on cross-validation in conjunction with a robust evaluation metric to estimate the optimal peak-to-peak threshold – a quantity commonly used for identifying bad trials in M/EEG. This approach is then extended to a more sophisticated algorithm which estimates this threshold for each sensor yielding trial-wise bad sensors. Depending on the number of bad sensors, the trial is then repaired by interpolation or by excluding it from subsequent analysis. All steps of the algorithm are fully automated thus lending itself to the name Autoreject. In order to assess the practical significance of the algorithm, we conducted extensive validation and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets containing MEG and EEG recordings from more than 200 subjects. The comparisons include purely qualitative efforts as well as quantitatively benchmarking against human supervised and semi-automated preprocessing pipelines. The algorithm allowed us to automate the preprocessing of MEG data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) going up to the computation of the evoked responses. The automated nature of our method minimizes the burden of human inspection, hence supporting scalability and reliability demanded by data analysis in modern neuroscience.}

	abstract = { Rectification of EMG signals is a common processing step used when performing electroencephalographic–electromyographic (EEG–EMG) coherence and EMG–EMG coherence. It is well known, however, that EMG rectification alters the power spectrum of the recorded EMG signal (interference EMG). The purpose of this study was to determine whether rectification of the EMG signal influences the capability of capturing the oscillatory input to a single EMG signal and the common oscillations between two EMG signals. Several EMG signals were reconstructed from experimentally recorded EMG signals from the surface of the first dorsal interosseus muscle and were manipulated to have an oscillatory input or common input (for pairs of reconstructed EMG signals) at various frequency bands (in Hz: 0–12, 12–30, 30–50, 50–100, 100–150, 150–200, 200–250, 250–300, and 300–400), one at a time. The absolute integral and normalized integral of power, peak power, and peak coherence (for pairs of EMG signals) were quantified from each frequency band. The power spectrum of the interference EMG accurately detected the changes to the oscillatory input to the reconstructed EMG signal, whereas the power spectrum of the rectified EMG did not. Similarly, the EMG–EMG coherence between two interference EMG signals accurately detected the common input to the pairs of reconstructed EMG signals, whereas the EMG–EMG coherence between two rectified EMG signals did not. The frequency band from 12 to 30 Hz in the power spectrum of the rectified EMG and the EMG–EMG coherence between two rectified signals was influenced by the input from 100 to 150 Hz but not from the input from 12 to 30 Hz. The study concludes that the power spectrum of the EMG and EMG–EMG coherence should be performed on interference EMG signals and not on rectified EMG signals because rectification impairs the identification of the oscillatory input to a single EMG signal and the common oscillatory input between two EMG signals. }

	abstract={The standard median filter based on a symmetric moving window has only one tuning parameter: the window width. Despite this limitation, this filter has proven extremely useful and has motivated a number of extensions: weighted median filters, recursive median filters, and various cascade structures. The Hampel filter is a member of the class of decsion filters that replaces the central value in the data window with the median if it lies far enough from the median to be deemed an outlier. This filter depends on both the window width and an additional tuning parameter t, reducing to the median filter when t=0, so it may be regarded as another median filter extension. This paper adopts this view, defining and exploring the class of generalized Hampel filters obtained by applying the median filter extensions listed above: weighted Hampel filters, recursive Hampel filters, and their cascades. An important concept introduced here is that of an implosion sequence, a signal for which generalized Hampel filter performance is independent of the threshold parameter t. These sequences are important because the added flexibility of the generalized Hampel filters offers no practical advantage for implosion sequences. Partial characterization results are presented for these sequences, as are useful relationships between root sequences for generalized Hampel filters and their median-based counterparts. To illustrate the performance of this filter class, two examples are considered: one is simulation-based, providing a basis for quantitative evaluation of signal recovery performance as a function of t, while the other is a sequence of monthly Italian industrial production index values that exhibits glaring outliers.},

  abstract = {Emotion sensing using physiological signals in real-life
              situations can be practically valuable. Previous studies have
              developed wearable devices that record autonomic nervous system
              activity, which reflects emotional arousal. However, no study
              determined whether emotional valence can be assessed using
              wearable devices. To this end, we developed a wearable device to
              record facial electromyography (EMG) from the corrugator
              supercilii (CS) and zygomatic major (ZM) muscles. To validate the
              device, in Experiment 1, we used a traditional wired device and
              our wearable device, to record participants' facial EMG while
              they were viewing emotional films. Participants viewed the films
              again and continuously rated their recalled subjective valence
              during the first viewing. The facial EMG signals recorded using
              both wired and wearable devices showed that CS and ZM activities
              were, respectively, negatively and positively correlated with
              continuous valence ratings. In Experiment 2, we used the wearable
              device to record participants' facial EMG while they were playing
              Wii Bowling games and assessed their cued-recall continuous
              valence ratings. CS and ZM activities were correlated negatively
              and positively, respectively, with continuous valence ratings.
              These data suggest the possibility that facial EMG signals
              recorded by a wearable device can be used to assess subjective
              emotional valence in future naturalistic studies.},

	abstract = {Affect recognition aims to detect a person's affective state based on observables, with the goal to e.g. improve human-computer interaction. Long-term stress is known to have severe implications on wellbeing, which call for continuous and automated stress monitoring systems. However, the affective computing community lacks commonly used standard datasets for wearable stress detection which a) provide multimodal high-quality data, and b) include multiple affective states. Therefore, we introduce WESAD, a new publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects during a lab study. The following sensor modalities are included: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Moreover, the dataset bridges the gap between previous lab studies on stress and emotions, by containing three different affective states (neutral, stress, amusement). In addition, self-reports of the subjects, which were obtained using several established questionnaires, are contained in the dataset. Furthermore, a benchmark is created on the dataset, using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. Considering the three-class classification problem ( baseline vs. stress vs. amusement ), we achieved classification accuracies of up to 80\%,. In the binary case ( stress vs. non-stress ), accuracies of up to 93\%, were reached. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the two device locations ( chest vs. wrist ) as well as the different sensor modalities.},

	ABSTRACT={Physiological response is an important component of an emotional episode. In this paper, we introduce a Toolbox for Emotional feAture Extraction from Physiological signals (TEAP). This open  source toolbox can preprocess and calculate emotionally relevant features from multiple physiological signals, namely, electroencephalogram (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), electromyogram (EMG), skin temperature, respiration pattern and blood volume pulse. The features from this toolbox are tested on two publicly available databases, i.e., MAHNOB-HCI and DEAP. We demonstrated that we achieve similar performance to the original work with the features from this toolbox. The toolbox is implemented in MATLAB and is also compatible with Octave.  We hope this toolbox to be further developed and accelerate research in affective physiological signal analysis.}

	abstract = {The spontaneous tendency to synchronize our facial expressions with those of others is often termed emotional contagion. It is unclear, however, whether emotional contagion depends on visual awareness of the eliciting stimulus and which processes underlie the unfolding of expressive reactions in the observer. It has been suggested either that emotional contagion is driven by motor imitation (i.e., mimicry), or that it is one observable aspect of the emotional state arising when we see the corresponding emotion in others. Emotional contagion reactions to different classes of consciously seen and “unseen” stimuli were compared by presenting pictures of facial or bodily expressions either to the intact or blind visual field of two patients with unilateral destruction of the visual cortex and ensuing phenomenal blindness. Facial reactions were recorded using electromyography, and arousal responses were measured with pupil dilatation. Passive exposure to unseen expressions evoked faster facial reactions and higher arousal compared with seen stimuli, therefore indicating that emotional contagion occurs also when the triggering stimulus cannot be consciously perceived because of cortical blindness. Furthermore, stimuli that are very different in their visual characteristics, such as facial and bodily gestures, induced highly similar expressive responses. This shows that the patients did not simply imitate the motor pattern observed in the stimuli, but resonated to their affective meaning. Emotional contagion thus represents an instance of truly affective reactions that may be mediated by visual pathways of old evolutionary origin bypassing cortical vision while still providing a cornerstone for emotion communication and affect sharing.}

Relatively high endurance was found in orbicularis oris, frontalis, and corrugator supercilii muscles; intermediate endurance was found in zygomaticus major, buccinator, and temporalis muscles; and low endurance was found in the masseter muscle. The last muscle showed a relatively fast linear decrease of the median frequency of the power spectrum. The other muscles showed a much slower, exponential decrease. The median frequency appeared to reflect reliably the changes in the shape of the power spectra during fatigue. Large differences between the shape of power spectra of different muscles in the unfatigued state were found. These, however, were unrelated to endurance and degree of spectral shift during fatigue. }
