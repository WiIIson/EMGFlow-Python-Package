It has been designed to facilitate the analysis of large datasets through batch processing of signal files, a common requirement in machine learning.</p><div class="tip custom-block" style="padding-top:8px;"><p>Want to see it in action?

Most tools offer only a limited set of extractable sEMG features, forcing researchers to combine multiple packages into a fragmented workflow. Other tools primarily focus on event detection within individual recordings and rely heavily on graphical user interfaces (GUIs), requiring considerable manual intervention. While suitable for processing individual, continuous recordings, these approaches become cumbersome when applied to larger datasets commonly used in machine learning.</p><p><em>EMGFlow</em>, a portmanteau of EMG and Workflow, addresses this limitation by offering a flexible processing pipeline capable of extracting a broad array of sEMG features. Its scalable architecture is specifically designed to handle extensive datasets efficiently, facilitating analysis in machine learning contexts.</p><h2 id="use-cases" tabindex="-1">Use cases <a class="header-anchor" href="#use-cases" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Use cases&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Machine learning</strong> <br><br>Extracting features from large datasets is a common task in machine learning and quantitative domains. <em>EMGFlow</em> supports this need through batch-processing, allowing users to either semi- or fully automate the treatment of sEMG recordings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experimental methods</strong> <br><br> EMGFlow is ideal for analysing data recorded from participants using standard experimental techniques (e.g., within/between/mixed designs). Researchers and clinicians without extensive knowledge of sEMG processing can analyse electromyographyic recordings with only a few lines of code. <em>EMGFlow</em> was designed with researchers in mind to streamline the process of cleaning and extraction of research-relevant features. Most functions in EMGFlow use common sense defaults, drawn from standard in the physiological and psychologcical literature, to generate reliable and reproducible results.</p></li></ul><h2 id="contributing" tabindex="-1">Contributing <a class="header-anchor" href="#contributing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Contributing&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We welcome contributions to the project.
