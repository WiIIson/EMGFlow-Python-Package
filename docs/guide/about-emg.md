# About Electromyography

## The nature of sEMG recordings

Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive technique that quantifies
muscle activity by recording voltages at the skin overlying a muscle, as
illustrated in Figure 1.

Voluntary movement arises from muscle contraction: motoneuron discharges
activate groups of fibers (motor units), generating motor‐unit action
potentials (MUAPs) that propagate along the fibers with a characteristic
conduction velocity, as illustrated in Figure 2.

Each discharge produces a brief force twitch; the superposition of many
twitches over time yields sustained force for actions such as lifting or
smiling (McManus, De Vito, & Lowery, 2020; De Luca, 2008). sEMG captures the
resulting voltage time series from which quantitative features are extracted
(Fridlund & Cacioppo, 1986).

## EMG Signal Processing Overview

EMG signal processing converts raw voltage time series into interpretable representations and features. Two complementary views are central:

- **Time domain** shows amplitude versus time. It reveals transients,
  drift, motion artefacts, and waveform shape. This view is used to select
  passband edges and to confirm that preprocessing preserves morphology.

- **Frequency domain** summarizes power versus frequency (power spectral
  density; PSD). It exposes mains peaks and harmonics and characterizes the
  bandwidth of physiological activity. This view is used to set notch
  parameters (`f0`, `Q`) and to verify that the chosen passband matches the
  target physiology.

Figure 3 illustrates how these views work together during preprocessing.
Panels A–D show the same signal segment before and after filtering in both the
time and frequency domains.

_Figure 3. Time and PSD views of the same sEMG segment. A) Raw time-series
shows drift and periodic contamination. B) Raw PSD shows mains peaks and
overall bandwidth. C) After notch and bandpass filtering, the time-series is
cleaned; the rectified-RMS envelope (thin line) provides amplitude over time.
D) Filtered PSD confirms removal of mains peaks and a defined passband._

### How to read Figure 3

- **A) Raw time series (time domain).** Inspect for low-frequency drift,
  motion artefacts, clipping, and bursts. Use this panel to choose passband
  edges and to ensure filters do not distort salient events.

- **B) Raw PSD (frequency domain).** Identify mains peaks (50/60 Hz and
  harmonics) and estimate the physiological band that contains most power. Use
  this panel to set notch parameters (`f0`, `Q`) and to motivate the bandpass.

- **C) Filtered time series with envelope.** After applying notch and
  bandpass filters, verify that drift and hum are removed while event shape is
  preserved. The rectified-RMS envelope aids visualization and feature
  extraction.

- **D) Filtered PSD.** Confirm that mains peaks are suppressed and that the
  passband matches the intended physiological range.

Together, the time- and frequency-domain views provide cross-checks: choose
and verify passband edges in time; select and verify notch parameters in
frequency.

## Domains of EMG Features

EMG features are commonly organized into:

- **Time-domain features** quantify amplitude and variability over time
  (e.g., RMS, MAV, iEMG, waveform length, Willison amplitude).

- **Frequency-domain features** quantify spectral location, spread, and shape
  (e.g., mean frequency, median frequency, bandwidth, spectral entropy).

- **Time–frequency features** track spectral content over time (e.g., windowed
  spectra or wavelets). EMGFlow emphasizes established time- and
  frequency-domain features; time–frequency analyses can be derived from the
  same PSD and envelope primitives when needed (see, e.g., Chowdhury
  et al., 2013).

## EMGFlow Definitions

### Signal

In EMGFlow, signals are represented as Pandas DataFrames, typically read from
CSV files. Standard EMGFlow DataFrames include:

- A `Time` column recording elapsed time (seconds).
- Additional columns for EMG signal magnitudes from each electrode.

Units for signal magnitudes should be consistent within each file to ensure
valid comparisons. The `Time` column is primarily for visualization and is not
essential for computations if the sampling rate is known. Any column labelled
`Time` is treated as a time reference and may be ignored during calculations.

### Sampling Rate

The sampling rate (`sampling_rate`) defines how many samples are recorded per
second. When `Time` is absent or irregular, the sampling rate specifies the
temporal spacing for analysis.

### Power Spectral Density (PSD)

A PSD DataFrame represents the frequency-domain view of an EMG signal obtained
via Fourier analysis. EMGFlow computes PSDs using Welch’s method—overlapped,
windowed averaging, typically with a Hann window—to produce stable spectral
estimates that complement the time-series view (LDS Group, 2003).
