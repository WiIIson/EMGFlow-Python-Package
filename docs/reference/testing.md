# Testing

## Running Test Code

_EMGFlow_ provides test files for ensuring the package functions properly. These test files are triggered every time the package is uploaded to GitHub, and the percentage of passing code is displayed. These tests can be ran manually to ensure your installed version of _EMGFlow_ is working properly as well.

First, you need to have _EMGFlow_ installed on your computer:
```bash
pip install EMGFlow
```

Once the package is installed, you can go [here](https://github.com/WiIIson/EMGFlow-Python-Package/tree/main/tests) on the GitHub page to download any of the test files. Once they are downloaded, they can be ran to test the corresponding module of the package.
